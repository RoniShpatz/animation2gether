Turn-Based Drawing – Each user adds a frame based on the previous one until someone decides to finish.
Automatic Animation Generation – Once finished, the frames are compiled into an animation.
My Animations Page – Users can view, delete, or share their completed animations.
Blog Sharing – Users can post their animations on the app’s blog for all users to see.
Post Management – Users can edit or delete only their own blog posts.
